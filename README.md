# Webpack Demo

<https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/>

Webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules.

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

Create a directory, initialize npm, install webpack locally, and install the webpack-cli.

```bash
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```
